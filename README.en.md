## 📋 Prerequisites

- ioBroker installation
- [nograx's zendure-solarflow adapter](https://github.com/nograx/ioBroker.zendure-solarflow) (installed & configured)
- Zendure device with ZenSDK: Solarflow 1600AC+, 2400AC+ or compatible
- Grid power meter (e.g., Shelly 3EM, Tasmota, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

In ioBroker Admin → Adapters → Install from custom URL:
```
https://github.com/Felliglanz/iobroker.zendure-automation
```

### Basic Configuration

1. **⚙️ Basic Settings**
   - Zendure Instance: `zendure-solarflow.0`
   - ProductKey & DeviceKey: Copy from zendure-solarflow object tree
   - Power Meter Datapoint: Your grid power sensor (Positive=consumption, Negative=feed-in)

2. **🎯 Zero Grid Control**
   - Target Grid Power: `0` W (for perfect zero feed-in)
   - Update Interval: `5` seconds (recommended)
   - Max Charge/Discharge Power: According to device specifications

3. **🔋 Battery Protection**
   - Choose protection mode: **SOC** (simple) or **Voltage** (precise)
   - **SOC Mode**: Min SOC 10%, Max SOC 100%
   - **Voltage Mode**: Min Voltage 3.18V (LFP), Hysteresis 0.1V

**That's it!** Default values for Relay Protection, Regulation, and Emergency are already optimally configured.

---

## 🔄 Multi-Device Support

**Control multiple Zendure devices as one unified system** – perfect for 2x Solarflow 2400 or larger installations.

### Activation

**⚙️ Basic Settings**
1. Enable checkbox **"Enable Multi-Device Support"**
2. Add devices in the device table:
   - ProductKey (from zendure-solarflow object tree)
   - DeviceKey (from zendure-solarflow object tree)
   - Name (optional, e.g., "Garage", "Basement")
   - Enabled (check box)

### How it Works

**Power Distribution:**
- **Equal Split** – power is distributed evenly across all active devices
- **Dynamic Exclusion** – devices at limits are automatically excluded
- **Per-Device Tracking** – each device has its own states in the object tree

**Example with 2x Solarflow 2400:**
```
I-Controller calculates: -1800W (charging)
→ Device 1: -900W
→ Device 2: -900W

Device 2 reaches max SOC (95%):
→ Device 1: -1800W (gets full power)
→ Device 2: 0W (excluded)
```

### Configuration

**Important:** All settings apply **globally to ALL devices**!

Configure values as if you had **a single device**:

| Parameter | Example 2400AC+ | Explanation |
|-----------|------------------|-------------|
| **maxDischargePowerW** | 2400 | Power **per device** |
| **maxChargePowerW** | 1200 | Power **per device** |
| **minBatterySoc** | 10% | Applies to **all devices** |
| **maxBatterySoc** | 95% | Applies to **all devices** |

The system automatically multiplies:
- 2 Devices × 2400W = **4800W Total Discharge**
- 2 Devices × 1200W = **2400W Total Charge**

> **⚠️ Interaction with Zendure App SOC Limits**  
> The adapter controls via ZenSDK (power setpoints in watts).  
> The Zendure app defines the allowed SOC range.  
> The **adapter values must be within the Zendure app limits**!  
> See section "🔋 Battery Protection Modes" for technical details.

### States (Object-Tree)

Multi-Device creates additional states:

**Global:**
- `status.totalPowerW` – Sum of all devices
- `status.avgSoc` – Average SOC

**Per Device (device1, device2, ...):**
- `status.devices.device1.soc` – Device SOC
- `status.devices.device1.powerW` – Current power
- `status.devices.device1.emergency` – Emergency status
- `status.devices.device1.excluded` – Excluded from distribution?

### Emergency Handling

**Per-Device Emergency:**
- Each device is monitored individually (SOC, voltage, flags)
- **If ONE device has emergency** → ALL eligible devices charge
- Emergency charge power is distributed across active devices

**Example:**
```
Device 1: Pack voltage 2.95V → EMERGENCY!
System: Charges both devices with 800W each (if active)
Device 2 reaches max SOC → Excluded, Device 1 continues charging alone
```

### Limits & Exclusion

A device is automatically excluded from distribution when:
- ✅ **Emergency Recovery active** (may only charge)
- ✅ **Voltage Recovery active** (may only charge)
- ✅ **Max SOC reached** (no more charging)
- ✅ **Min SOC reached** (no more discharging)

**Excluded devices** are set to **0W**, others continue regulating normally.

### Hardware Protection

**The Good News:** Solarflow hardware has its own limits!
- Even if you configure "too high" values → hardware blocks them
- Maximum safety through dual protection (software + hardware)

**Best Practice:**
- Configure correct values for optimal control quality
- When in doubt: hardware protects itself ✓

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### 🔋 Battery Protection Modes in Detail

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Adapter ↔ Zendure System Interaction**  
> 
> **What does the adapter do?**
> - Writes **only power setpoints** (watts) via ZenSDK: `setDeviceAutomationInOutLimit`
> - Reads SOC, voltage, etc. for monitoring
> - Does **NOT** set SOC boundaries in the Zendure system
> 
> **How does the control work?**
> ```  
> Zendure App:  Defines allowed SOC range (hardware limit)
> Adapter:      Controls within this range (software limit)
> ```
> 
> **Technical Process:**
> 1. You configure in Zendure app: e.g., 5% - 100%
> 2. You configure in adapter: e.g., 10% - 90%
> 3. Adapter controls between 10% and 90%
> 4. Zendure hardware allows maximum 5% to 100%
> 
> **What happens on conflict?**
> ```
> Zendure App:  10% - 90%   ← Narrow limits
> Adapter:       5% - 95%   ← Wants to use more
> → Adapter sends charge command at 91% SOC
> → Zendure hardware blocks (max 90%)
> → Validation error in adapter log
> → Control doesn't work correctly
> ```
> 
> **Configuration Rule:**
> Adapter values must be **within** Zendure app limits.  
> Where exactly you set your limits depends on your use case.

**SOC Mode**
- Simple, reliable
- Min/Max SOC percentage limits
- Uses SOC from device
- **ATTENTION:** Adapter values must be within Zendure app limits (see warning above!)

**Voltage Mode (Recommended for Multi-Pack)**
- Monitors `packData.*.minVol` of each pack
- Uses lowest value (protects weakest pack)
- Voltage recovery hysteresis prevents oscillation through relaxation
- Example: Min 3.18V + Hysteresis 0.1V → Recovery only at 3.28V
- **Additional safety** beside SOC limits (both modes active in parallel!)

### ⚡ Relay Protection (Anti-Wear)

Protects hardware from excessive switching, especially in variable weather:

| Parameter | Recommended | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Feed-in Threshold** | -150W | Feed-in needed for charge start |
| **Feed-in Delay** | 5 Ticks | 25s sustained feed-in |
| **Discharge Threshold** | 200W | Grid consumption needed for discharge start |
| **Discharge Delay** | 3 Ticks | 15s sustained consumption |
| **Operating Deadband** | 5W | Minimum power before zero crossing |

**Operating Deadband (v0.6.1 new):**
- Holds at ±5W for 1 tick before allowing 0W or sign change
- Prevents relay chattering during oscillation around target
- Works together with 10W safe-switch (switches only at ~0.04A)

### 🎚️ Control Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Hysteresis** | 50W | Minimum change for reaction |
| **Charge Ramp** | 100W/cycle | Gentle charging |
| **Discharge Ramp** | 400W/cycle | Fast load response |
| **EMA Filter Alpha** | 0.5 | Grid power smoothing (0.1-1.0) |

**Tip:** Higher ramps = more aggressive, lower = gentler & hardware-friendly

### 📊 EMA Filter (Exponential Moving Average)

Smooths the grid power signal to avoid reacting to fast load spikes (TV, microwave):

| Alpha | Behavior | Use Case |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **0.1 - 0.3** | Very sluggish, strong smoothing | Frequent load spikes, relaxed control |
| **0.4 - 0.6** | ⭐ Balanced (recommended) | Standard application |
| **0.7 - 0.9** | Fast, little smoothing | Fast response desired |
| **1.0** | No filtering | Pure I-controller like v0.6.0 |

**Formula:** `filtered = alpha × new + (1 - alpha) × old`

**When to adjust?**
- **Too sluggish?** → Increase alpha (e.g., 0.5 → 0.7)
- **Too jittery?** → Decrease alpha (e.g., 0.5 → 0.3)
- **No filter?** → Alpha = 1.0 (legacy behavior)

### 🚨 Emergency & Recovery

**Emergency Charging** (highest priority):
- Activated at: `lowVoltageBlock` flag OR voltage < 3.0V
- Charges with 800W until exit SOC (20%)
- Overrides all other automations

**Recovery Mode**:
- Active from 20% to 30% SOC (configurable)
- **Discharge blocked**, further charging allowed (only with PV surplus)
- Prevents emergency loops

---

## 🧮 How does the Algorithm work?

**I-Controller Formula** (inspired by OpenDTU-OnBattery):
```javascript
newBatteryPower = lastBatteryPower + (currentGridPower - targetGridPower)
```

**Examples:**
- Grid draws 300W, target 0W → Battery discharges with 300W
- Grid feeds 200W, target 0W → Battery charges with 200W

**Sign Convention:**
- Battery: Negative=charging, Positive=discharging
- Grid: Positive=consumption, Negative=feed-in
